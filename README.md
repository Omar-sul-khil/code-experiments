#  Code Experiments

A personal repository of small coding experiments and practice scripts for learning, exploration, and improving programming skills.

##  Overview
This repository contains short pieces of code written to:
- Test programming concepts  
- Experiment with different languages and libraries  
- Strengthen problem-solving and logical thinking  

Each file or folder may cover a unique idea, algorithm, or simple project.

##  Technologies
Currently exploring and coding with:
- **Java**


##  Purpose
The goal of this repository is continuous learning — writing code daily, experimenting freely, and documenting progress through practice.

##  Notes
- Most scripts are independent and written for educational purposes.  
- Feel free to explore, reuse, or suggest improvements.  

“The best way to learn to code is by writing code.”
